# San Francisco Recommended Standard

In PROGRESS: Full DRAFT FORTHCOMING&gt;&gt;&gt;March 30, 2018



## Description of Standard

The purpose of this data standard is to support the consistent collection, maintenance and reporting of data on race and ethnicity across Departments. Consistent race and ethnicity data will:

* Improve our ability to track and compare differences across City services and programs
* Help inform policy and procedural changes to reduce disparities across City services and programs

The categories in this standard come from the Census 2015 National Content Test and like the Census are not genetically, anthropologically, or scientifically based. Instead the categories represent a socio-political construct. The Census 2015 National Content Test consisted of a sample of 1.2 million households making it the largest and most thorough testing and validation of detailed racial and ethnic categories. This standard relies heavily on this research as well extensive testing done by the OMB Tabulation Working Group for the 1997 race/ethnicity standard.
