# San Francisco Recommended Standard

In PROGRESS: Full DRAFT FORTHCOMING&gt;&gt;&gt;March 30, 2018

## Description of Standard

The purpose of this data standard is to support the consistent collection, maintenance and reporting of data on race and ethnicity across Departments. Consistent race and ethnicity data will:

* Improve our ability to track and compare differences across City services and programs
* Help inform policy and procedural changes to reduce disparities across City services and programs

The categories in this standard come from the Census 2015 National Content Test and like the Census are not genetically, anthropologically, or scientifically based. Instead the categories represent a socio-political construct. The Census 2015 National Content Test consisted of a sample of 1.2 million households making it the largest and most thorough testing and validation of detailed racial and ethnic categories. This standard relies heavily on this research as well extensive testing done by the OMB Tabulation Working Group for the 1997 race/ethnicity standard.

## Standard or Guideline

### Collection Protocol

1. **Self-identification preferred.** Respect for individual dignity should guide the processes and methods for collecting data on race and ethnicity. Use self-identification when feasible and practical. If self-identification is not feasible or practical at the point of collection, departments should provide a later opportunity for individuals to self-identify.
   1. **Exception.** When collecting data for purposes of understanding bias in perceptions, use perceived race and ethnicity. For example, data collection on stops must use perceived race and ethnicity.
2. **Multiple selections must be allowed.** Respondents or data collectors must be allowed to select more than one response.
3. **Refusal to answer.** If the respondent does not answer the race/ethnicity question, the interviewer may repeat the question and response options. If the respondent fails to respond to the question, the interviewer may infer a response \(based upon observation or information provided by another source\).
4. **Training.** If staff will be collecting data verbally per this standard, Departments should develop and implement standard training.

### Question Format

Below are formats you should use when collecting race and ethnicity data. The formats below address:

* **Ability to collect multiple values. **Not all systems are able to collect multiple selections for a single field value. Use the formats as follows:
  * Format A. Use this format if your system allows for the selection of multiple values. Most modern systems should be able to accommodate this.
  * Format B. Use this format if your system is unable to select multiple values.
* **Option to collect detailed data. **Under each format option or via subsequent questions, you can collect additional details on subgroups. Each detailed option must roll up into a one of the 7 standard groups \(1\). See Appendix E for suggested options.

### Reporting
At a minimum, you should calculate the following estimates when reporting on race and ethnicity data.

* Each race and ethnicity alone. This table will provide a Census compatible table that sums to 100%. To create this table, report the following groups:
White alone
Asian alone
Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish alone
Black or African American alone
American Indian or Alaska Native alone
Middle Eastern or Northern African alone
Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander alone
Two or more races
Each race and ethnicity plus some other race. This table will sum to more than 100%. To create this table, report the following groups:
White plus any other race and ethnicity
Asian plus any other race and ethnicity
Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish plus any other race and ethnicity
Black or African American plus any other race and ethnicity
American Indian or Alaska Native plus any other race and ethnicity
Middle Eastern or Northern African plus any other race and ethnicity
Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander plus any other race and ethnicity
