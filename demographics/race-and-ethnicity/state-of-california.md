We know of only one California standard that faces a City Department. If you know of others, regardless of whether or not they apply to City Departments, please contact someone at DataSF.

## Racial and Identity Profiling Act of 2015 Regulations

### Description of Standard

Under the California Racial and Identity Profiling Act of 2015 \(AB 953\), state and local law enforcement agencies must collect data regarding stops of individuals, including perceived demographic information on the person stopped. They must report this data to the California Attorney General's Office.

As part of this law, the California Attorney General’s Office issued regulations that detail how stops data must be collected. This data standard includes data on race and ethnicity. Below is the race and ethnicity excerpt from the state regulations. The [full standard is available online](https://oag.ca.gov/ab953/regulations).

> **Caution:** This data standard only applies to the Police Department in the context of stops data. As a result, the data standard requires perception of race and ethnicity and the standard reflects this in the categories used. This is due to the purpose of the data collection, including to identify potential bias. In contrast, other standards rely on self-identification, which typically leads to different categories

### Standard or Guideline

Below is an excerpt from the standard.

> “Perceived Race or Ethnicity of Person Stopped” refers to the officer’s perception of the race or ethnicity of the person stopped. When reporting this data element, the officer shall make his or her determination of the person’s race or ethnicity based on personal observation only.
