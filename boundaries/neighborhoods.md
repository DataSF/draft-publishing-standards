# Neighborhoods

DataSF provides the [Analysis Neighborhoods](https://data.sfgov.org/Geographic-Locations-and-Boundaries/Analysis-Neighborhoods/p5b7-5n3h) as the primary neighborhood district boundary on automated datasets. We will also provide other neighborhood boundaries when appropriate. 

The table below includes:
- the name and link to each of the neighborhood districts
- the human readable column name used on the open data portal
- the application programming interface (API) name
- the shortname used when there are character limits (e.g. in shapefile formats)
- the number of districts included in the dataset
