# Neighborhoods

The City's Open Data Program provides the [Analysis Neighborhoods](https://data.sfgov.org/Geographic-Locations-and-Boundaries/Analysis-Neighborhoods/p5b7-5n3h) as the primary neighborhood district boundary on automated datasets. We will also provide other neighborhood boundaries when appropriate.

The table below includes:

* the name and link to each of the neighborhood districts
* the human readable column name used on the open data portal
* the application programming interface \(API\) name
* the shortname used when there are character limits \(e.g. in shapefile formats\)
* the number of districts included in the dataset

| Dataset | Column Name \(Human Readable\) | API Name | Short Name | Number of Neighborhoods |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |

**Note:** Datasets published before we codified this practice may not reflect the above. We are actively improving existing datasets on a rolling basis. Please consult the data dictionary and other related documentation under the dataset's About tab. If it's still unclear, [contact DataSF](http://support.datasf.org/customer/portal/emails/new), and we'll be happy to help.
