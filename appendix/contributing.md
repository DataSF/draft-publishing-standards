# Contributing

All of this documentation is open source and [available to edit on GitHub](https://github.com/datasf/draft-publishing-standards). If you see something that you can contribute, submit a pull request with your edits! To make this easy you can click the _"Edit this page"_ link at the top of the web docs.

The docs are all written in [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/). If you've used GitHub, it's pretty likely you've encountered it before. You can become a pro in a few minutes by reading their [GFM Documentation page](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/).

## Organizing Files

You'll notice that the [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/datasf/draft-publishing-standards) is in a logical structure. Each of the major sections is a folder. For example the 'Reference: Basemap' pages are in the folder `basemap` in the top level of the repository.

Some of the chapters are split into multiple sections to help break up the content and make it easier to digest. You can easily see how chapters are laid out by looking at the `SUMMARY.md` file. This convention helps keep chapters together in the file system and easy to view either directly on github or gitbook.

## Table of Contents

You'll find the table of contents in the [SUMMARY.md](https://github.com/datasf/draft-publishing-standards/blob/master/SUMMARY.md) file. It's a nested list of markdown links. You can link to a file simply by putting the filename \(including the extension\) inside the link target.

## Introduction Page

This is the root [README.md](https://github.com/datasf/draft-publishing-standards/blob/master/README.md) file. It's intent is to give the reader an elevator pitch of what this document is about is and why we think it is useful.

## Send a Pull Request

So that's it. You make your edits, keep your files and the Table of Contents organized, and [send us a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).
