# Draft Publishing Standards

DataSF is the City and County of San Francisco's official open data program. We are establishing standards to make data more useful and consistent across the City and at scale. These standards focus on the global perspective across datasets rather than on particular datasets. For example, it may be hard for a data user to trace which neighborhood boundary a field references. The standards contained in this document attempt to address that issue among others.

The DataSF team learns more every day, so this document is always in draft and open to feedback. Also, we're writing this as we go, so we have not documented all emerging standards here yet.
