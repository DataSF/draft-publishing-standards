# Formats
Some scratch thoughts on string formats:

Camel case
* Address String
* Categories when either the source system presents them this way or it is easy to interpret from the source

Upper case
* Acronyms - e.g - PSA (Park Service Area)
* States - e.g. CA

Lower case
* Categories when the source system presents them in caps and there's no way to interpret them to camel case
