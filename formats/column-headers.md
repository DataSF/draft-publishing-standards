# Column Headers

- Only use alphanumeric or these 3 special characters: .-_
    - Ampersand (&) should be replaced by “and” if needed
- Each must be unique
    - Can’t have two headers called "duration"
- Units of measure should be omitted
- Keep short (less than 30 characters)
    - A full description can and should be provided with the data dictionary
    
# Column Order

- *Date and time variables* should be in the first column for time series data
- *Fixed variables* should be ordered with the highest-level variable on the left and most granular variable on the right
- *Observed variables* should always be on the rightmost columns

### Is anything wrong, unclear, missing?
