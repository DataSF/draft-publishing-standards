# Text

* UTF-8 encoding should be used
  * This ensures that special characters can be decoded by users
* No line breaks within cells
  * This can break parsing in software like Excel, introducing data integrity issues

## Considerations for categorical variables

* Please maintain consistency with canonical and standard reference lists
  * This helps with analysis across departments and data systems
* Common ones are provided as reference within this document, including the departmental steward of the list where applicable and links to the reference data

## Character case

Text should be presented in the easiest to interpret/read format where appropriate.

**Title case**

* Address String
* Categories when either the source system presents them this way or it is easy to interpret from the source

**Upper case**

* Acronyms - e.g - PSA \(Park Service Area\)
* States - e.g. CA

**Lower case**

* Categories when the source system presents them in caps and there's no way to interpret them to camel case
* Research suggests lower case as opposed to uppercase is easier to read for humans and just as useful to machines, note exceptions above

### Is anything wrong, unclear, missing?

-Do we want to link to resources about things like line breaks.  Will everyone know how to detect/remove/what they are?
