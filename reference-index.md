# Reference Data Index

Below is a table of all the reference datasets mentioned in this document.

| Dataset | Description and Constraints | Reference Columns | Page |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [List of Streets and Intersections](https://data.sfgov.org/Geographic-Locations-and-Boundaries/List-of-Streets-and-Intersections/pu5n-qu5c) | A list of street segments and intersections sorted by street name and ascending address number. This data set is based on the City's GIS basemap and contains CNN id numbers for each record. | `cnn` as number <br> For segments: `from_cnn` and `to_cnn` define the node IDs at each end | [Street Centerlines and Nodes](/basemap/street-centerlines-nodes.md) |
| [San Francisco Basemap Street Centerlines](hhttps://data.sfgov.org/Geographic-Locations-and-Boundaries/Street-Names/6d9h-4u5v) | A geographic reference of the all basemap streets including centerline node network identifiers and jurisdictions | `cnn` as number <br> `cnntext` as text <br>`f_node_cnn` as the starting (from) node ID <br> `t_node_cnn` as the ending (to) node ID | [Street Centerlines and Nodes](/basemap/street-centerlines-nodes.md) |
| [Street Segment and Intersection (CNN) Change Log](https://data.sfgov.org/Geographic-Locations-and-Boundaries/Street-Segment-and-Intersection-CNN-Change-Log/amiw-iisi) | A list of Street Segment and Intersection (CNN) changes including new, dropped, realigned, divided and split records. | `oldcnn` as number <br> `newcnn` as number| [Street Centerlines and Nodes](/basemap/street-centerlines-nodes.md) |
| [Street Names](hhttps://data.sfgov.org/Geographic-Locations-and-Boundaries/Street-Names/6d9h-4u5v) | Contains a list of officially valid street names contained in the City's Basemap | `fullstreetname` composed of `streetname` & `streettype` | [Street Names](/basemap/street-names.md) |
| [San Francisco Basemap Street Centerlines](hhttps://data.sfgov.org/Geographic-Locations-and-Boundaries/Street-Names/6d9h-4u5v) | A geographic reference of the all basemap streets including a number of street components like the valid name | `streetname` composed of `street` & `st_type` | [Street Names](/basemap/street-names.md) |
| [Current Subdivision Parcels](https://data.sfgov.org/Geographic-Locations-and-Boundaries/Subdivision-Parcels-aka-City-Lots-/45et-ht7c) | These are the current active recorded parcels. The geography can be used as reference but should not be used for anything requiring precision. | `block_num` `lot_num` `blklot` | [Parcels](/basemap/parcels.md) |
| [Recorded Parcel Geography with Transaction Date History](https://data.sfgov.org/Geographic-Locations-and-Boundaries/Recorded-Parcel-Geography-with-Transaction-Date-Hi/3iun-6we5) | These are the current and historic parcels with recorded dates. Historic parcels only go back to about 1995 with some exceptions. Useful for tying historic administrative records to a location. The geography can be used as reference but should not be used for anything requiring precision. | `block_num` `lot_num` `blklot` | [Parcels](/basemap/parcels.md) |
| [San Francisco Assessor Blocks](https://data.sfgov.org/Geographic-Locations-and-Boundaries/San-Francisco-Assessor-Blocks/ndp2-nsue) | Just the blocks without lots | `block_num` for block | [Parcels](/basemap/parcels.md) |
| [Addresses - Enterprise Addressing System](https://data.sfgov.org/Geographic-Locations-and-Boundaries/Addresses-Enterprise-Addressing-System/sr5d-tnui) | The EAS is the system of record for DBI when assigning official addresses. Associated coordinates are most often associated with the center of a parcel or close to it, rather than at the door or entry. This still allows associations, but it means that in certain cases a building footprint cannot be spatially matched via intersection or "point in polygon" with it's address\(es\). | `address_number` | [Address Numbers](/basemap/address-numbers.md) |
| [Addresses with Units - Enterprise Addressing System](https://data.sfgov.org/Geographic-Locations-and-Boundaries/Addresses-Enterprise-Addressing-System/sr5d-tnui) | Same general limitations as the Addresses dataset above, but also includes sub-addresses like units. Unit numbers are formally referenced for condos because the City records these for the purposes of properly tying deeds and other property records to a specific unit and owner. Rental units are not formally recorded by the City. | `address_number` |
